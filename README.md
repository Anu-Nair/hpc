Codes based on CUDA, MPI and OpenMP

## Open MP
1.Write an OpenMP program  to multiply two matrices A & B and find the resultant matrix C <br>
2.Write an OpenMP program to show how first private clause works.(Factorial program) <br>
3.Write an OpenMP program to find the number of processes, number of threads, etc (the environment information).<br>
4.Write an OpenMP program which performs C=A+B  & D=A-B in separate blocks/sections where A,B,C & D  are arrays.<br>
5.Write an OpenMP program to add all the elements of two arrays A & B each of size 1000 and store their sum in a variable using reduction clause.<br>
6.Write an OpenMP program to find the largest element in an array using critical section.<br>
7.Write an OpenMP program to show how thread private clause works.<br>
8.Write an OpenMP program to perform addition of two arrays A & B store the result in the array C(scheduling concept)<br>

## MPI
1.Write an MPI program where the master processor broadcasts a message “HELLO MSRIT” to the remaining processors using broadcast system call.<br>
2.Write a MPI program to find sum of 'n' integers on 'p' processors using  point-to-point communication libraries call<br>
3.Write a MPI program to send the message from a process whose rank=3 to all other remaining processes.<br>
4.Write a MPI program scatter the information to different processes.<br>

## CUDA programs
1.Write a CUDA program for adding two vectors.<br>
2.Write a CUDA program to print the message “Hello World” and demonstrate threads by varying BLOCK_WIDTH to different sizes.<br>
3.Write a CUDA program to print the message “Hello World” and demonstrate threads by varying ThreadId to different sizes.<br>
4.Write a CUDA program to multiply two matrices<br>
